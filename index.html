    Hello, I'm a highschool student from Traverse City Michigan. I like to code, play games, and like to mess with computers (especially the raspberry pi). I took up coding at the start of the school year when I took a computer science class that focused around javascript. I then started teaching myself Python with my dad's help. I do have a summer job at a harbor and help maintain the place by fixing things. I've spent most of my life doing stuff on computers. Most of the time it's gaming but I do spend a lot of my time trying to understand what all the parts do in a computer and understand code, which is a lot harder. But with my little experience in coding I have learned that once you get the basics down with a certain coding language that it is much easier to learn the rest. </p>
